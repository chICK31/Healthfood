        <h2>Our Mission: Transparency and Health for Everyone</h2>
        <p>At our core, we believe that everyone deserves to know the truth about what they eat. In a world where food is often marketed as "healthy" when it’s anything but, our mission is to cut through the noise and provide <strong>completely transparent</strong> and accurate information about the foods you consume.</p>
        
        <p>We aim to empower you by sharing the science behind the nutrition—showing you exactly which foods support your health and which ones might be causing harm. By focusing on the impact of inflammation, we help you make choices that leave you feeling stronger, energized, and healthier.</p>
        
        <p>Our platform is <strong>free of charge</strong>, <strong>open source</strong>, and built with the sole purpose of helping people live better lives. We believe in honesty and accessibility, ensuring that anyone, anywhere, can access the tools and knowledge to make informed decisions about their diet.</p>
        
        <p>Inflammation is the root of many chronic health issues, and we’re here to help you identify and avoid the foods that contribute to it. Together, we can create a healthier, happier, and more vibrant future—one meal at a time.</p>
    
        <p><strong>Work in Progress:</strong> This is a growing project, and we’re constantly working to improve. Your feedback is invaluable to us! If you have suggestions, ideas, or ways we can do better, please share them! We don't bite! Together, we can make this tool even more effective and impactful for everyone.</p>
